fix(budaya): resolve interactive map issues in Chrome/Edge browsers

## Problem
- Interactive map not working in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- Map interactions (clicks on markers) only worked in Firefox
- Inconsistent data fetching across browsers

## Root Causes
1. Direct Supabase client-side queries behaved differently in Chrome vs Firefox
2. CORS and RLS policy issues with browser-to-database connections
3. Coordinate type coercion (DECIMAL returned as string vs number)
4. Pointer events and z-index conflicts in Chromium rendering engine

## Solution
### Changed data fetching method:
- BEFORE: Direct Supabase client calls in browser
- AFTER: Fetch via Next.js API Routes (server-side)

### Benefits:
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all browsers
- ✅ Server-side query execution (no CORS issues)
- ✅ Proper RLS policy application
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Type safety for coordinates

## Changes
- `app/budaya/page.tsx`: Changed to fetch from API routes
- `app/api/budaya/route.ts`: Added debug logging and cache headers
- `app/api/budaya/kabupatens/route.ts`: Added debug logging
- `components/MapSumbar.tsx`: Enhanced pointer events for Chromium
- `utils/supabase/client.ts`: Added environment variable validation
- Added debug documentation and testing tools

## Testing
Run with debug mode:
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_DEBUG=1

npm run dev
```

Test API:
```bash
node test-api.mjs
```

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Safari
